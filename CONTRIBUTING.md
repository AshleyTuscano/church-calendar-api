# church-calendar-api vs. calendarium-romanum

If you want to contribute a calendar data file,
additional localization,
fix or report a calendar computing error,
please, head over to the [calendarium-romanum][caro] repository
and open a pull-request or an issue there.
Church Calendar API itself is only a thin presentation layer
around the `calendarium-romanum` gem.
Everything else (data, computation) is handled
by `calendarium-romanum`.
