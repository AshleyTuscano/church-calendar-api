  %h1 API Documentation

%p
  The Church Calendar API provides access to calendar data
  for any day.
  You may explore the API by following the links bellow and experimenting
  with the URIs.

%h2 Specify API Version

%p
  API version must be specified at the beginning of each request path
  %code /api/:version/:lang
  \- right now the API only has version 0 and language English:
  %code /api/v0/en

%p
  In the following examples this common beginning is omitted.

%h2 Select Calendar to Query

.panel.panel-default
  .panel-heading
    %b
      %a{href: '/api/v0/en/calendars'} /calendars
  .panel-body
    %p
      The API offers several sanctorale calendars to choose from -
      e.g. General Roman Calendar in Latin and English.
      %code /calendars
      returns list of their identifiers.
    %pre
      = preserve do
        :escaped
          [
            "default",
            "general-la",
            "general-en",
            "czech"
          ]

.panel.panel-default#calendar-desc
  .panel-heading

      %a{href: '/api/v0/en/calendars/default'} /calendars/:cal
    %br
    %a{href: '/api/v0/en/calendars/default'} /calendars/default
    %br
    %a{href: '/api/v0/en/calendars/general-la'} /calendars/general-la
  .panel-body
    %p
      Fetches description of the selected calendar.
    %p
      The description has two parts.
      %b system
      describes the calendar system (which is the same for the whole API),
      %b sanctorale
      describes the selected set of data of sanctorale feasts.

    %pre
      = preserve do
        :escaped
          {
            "system": {
              "promulgated": 1969,
              "desc": "promulgated by motu proprio Mysterii Paschalis of Paul VI. (AAS 61 (1969), pp. 222-226)."
            },
            "sanctorale": {
              "title": "Calendarium Romanum Generale",
              "language": "la"
            }
          }

%h2 Query the Calendar

.panel.panel-default
  .panel-heading
    %b
      %a{href: '/api/v0/en/calendars/default/today'} /calendars/:cal/today
    %br
    %a{href: '/api/v0/en/calendars/general-la/today'} /calendars/general-la/today
  .panel-body
    %p
      Returns calendar entry for the current day.
      Don't use this endpoint if you need to serve audience
      in different timezones or in a single timezone different
      from the API server's one.

    %pre
      = preserve do
        :escaped
          {
            "date":"2015-06-27",
            "season":"ordinary",
            "season_week":12,
            "celebrations":[
              {"title":"","colour":"green","rank":"ferial","rank_num":3.13},
              {"title":"Saint Cyril of Alexandria, bishop and doctor","colour":"white","rank":"optional memorial","rank_num":3.12}
            ],
            "weekday":"saturday"
          }

.alert.alert-info
  %p
    If you wish to query the
    %a{href: '/api/v0/en/calendars/default'} default calendar,
    you may omit
    %code /calendars/default
    from the path. The API will redirect you with status 301
    to the full path.
    E.g.
    %code
      %a{href: '/api/v0/en/today'} /today
    redirects to
    %code /calendars/default/today
    This is especially useful when exploring the API manually through
    the address bar of your browser or
    %b curl
    in the command line.

.panel.panel-default
  .panel-heading
    %b
      %a{href: '/api/v0/en/calendars/default/2015/6/27'} /calendars/:cal/:year/:month/:day
    %br
    %a{href: '/api/v0/en/calendars/default/2015/6/27'} /calendars/default/2015/6/27
    %br
    %a{href: '/api/v0/en/calendars/default/1994/9/1'} /calendars/default/1994/9/1
    or
    %a{href: '/api/v0/en/calendars/default/1994/09/01'} /calendars/default/1994/09/01
  .panel-body
    %p
      Returns
      %a{href: '#day-struct'} Day entry
      for the specified day.

    .alert.alert-warning
      %p
        %strong.text-uppercase Plese note:
        The API refuses requests for dates with year being older than
        the year of promulgation of the implemented calendar system.
        You can find it by hitting the
        %a{href: '#calendar-desc'} calendar description route.

.panel.panel-default
  .panel-heading
    %b
      %a{href: '/api/v0/en/calendars/default/2015/6'} /calendars/:cal/:year/:month
    %br
    %a{href: '/api/v0/en/calendars/default/2015/6'} /calendars/default/2015/6
  .panel-body
    %p
      Returns an array of
      %a{href: '#day-struct'} Day entries
      for all days of the specified month

.panel.panel-default
  .panel-heading
    %b
      %a{href: '/api/v0/calendars/default/en/2015'} /calendars/:cal/:year
    %br
    %a{href: '/api/v0/calendars/default/en/2015'} /calendars/default/2015
  .panel-body
    %pre
      {"lectionary":"C","ferial_lectionary":2}

    %p
      Returns the year's common "liturgical setup".

    .alert.alert-warning
      %strong.text-uppercase Important:
      The way this endpoint works might not be obvious
      at the first glance.
      The problem is that the civil and Catholic liturgical year do not match.
      A liturgical year begins in November or December with the 1st Sunday of Advent.
      Thus
      %code /api/v0/en/2015
      returns information concerning the liturgical year 2015-2016
      and if you want to know which lectionary cycle is in use in June 2015,
      you have to call
      %code /api/v0/en/2014

%h2 Data Structures

The API mostly returns representations of liturgical days.
On each liturgical day one or more celebrations occur.
